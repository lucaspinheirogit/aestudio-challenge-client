## Project's structure

I decided to keep it as simple as possible and not overengineer too much, and make it look awesome, of course.

- **Separate imports** (dependencies, absolute imports, relative imports)
- **Container and presentational components pattern**
- **Very descritive names**
  - _Component.container_ (State and logic)
  - _Component.styles_ (Styles using styled-components)
  - _Component.test_ (Tests)
  - _Component_ (presentational)

## Final thoughts

Well, It was very fun to develop this challenge and add some minor features to improve the user's experience such as a responsive table and an initial page loading screen.
